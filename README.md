```
+-------------------+      +-------------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Angular Frontend | <--> |   Spring Boot Backend   | <--> |  MySQL Database   |
|   (User Interface)|      |  (REST APIs & Logic)    |      | (Data Storage)    |
+-------------------+      +-------------------------+      +-------------------+
